Basic features to the game:

    1. You control the player using W A S D, and spacebar (the spacebar slows the player down)

    2. When you bounce off the wall, your speed can either increase or decrease

    3. There is sound to the game (turn up volume)

    4. The more green balls the player interacts with, the more red balls spawned

    5. A high-score is kept track if the player does not reload the page
